    <p>
      Plutonium is a web-based platform for the digital aspects of courses of study, usually within educational institutions. They present resources, activities, and interactions within a course structure and provide for the different stages of assessment. VLEs also usually report on participation; and have some level of integration with other institutional systems.[1][2]
For teachers and instructors who edit them, VLEs may have a fact role as authoring and design environments.[3] VLEs have been adopted by almost all higher education institutions in the English-speaking world
